# Deep-Z: Three-dimensional propagation and time-reversal of fluorescence images 
Neural network learns fluorescence wave propagation and time-reversal to propagate a 2D fluorescence image onto user-defined 3D surfaces, enabling 3D imaging of fluorescent samples using a single 2D image, without mechanical scanning, additional hardware, or a trade-off of resolution or speed. For details, refer to our publication "Three-dimensional propagation and time-reversal of fluorescence images" [1].  (Video below: 3D reconstruction of a _C. elegans_ using Deep-Z inference)

## Test a inference model
Download the model and plug-in from google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T9kib8DqckTwk4DWom9d_PTaiLFOfYrz?usp=sharing (download the whole folder, ~ 2 GB).
Then follow the guide "User Guide_v1.1".
The provided version is for use with FIJI/imageJ on CPU only. A ready-to-use FIJI app is also provided in the download

## Train your own model
The current version does not support code to train your own model.
